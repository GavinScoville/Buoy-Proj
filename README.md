# The goal of this program is to make you aware of the wave conditions in the Straight of Juan de Fuca

## Download NOAA data (waves and tides) 
Every 15 minutes I retrieve new infomration from NOAA on the waves, tides, current, and wind. See fetch_bouy_funcitons.py to see the functions that call on the NOAA API. This data is collected by NOAA bouys such as the[New Dungeness Buoy](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=46088). 

 Description of on NOAA bouy measurments is [available here](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/faq/measdes.shtml)

## Make predictions as to what windows conditions are good 
I am currently using a very simplistic newtonian model. 
This will hopefully will get updated with a stochastic model, which requres fewer violated assumtions. If I have free time I might look into numerical methods so I can include the coreolis effect, bathymetry, wind, tides, and currents in a deterministic model. 

### Process of Building Wave Report: 
Wave report is stored in Juan_de_Fuca.py 
#### Step 1: Predict Waves off Pacific Ocean and when they will reach Neah Bay 
These predictions are stored in data/predicted/Neah

#### Step 2: Predict which waves hitting Neah Bay will make it to Fort Ebey 
Azimuth from Neah Bay to Fort Ebey is about 100째 E of N. A wave with an 11 second period traveling in 100m water moves about 17 meters/s. Tidal Currents can add +- 1.5 meters/s to this speed. 

#### Step 3: Identify when waves pass Port Angelis, and New Dungeness
Qualify that yes waves did make in into the straight. Ebey should be firing 

#### Step 4: Include Wind Waves genrated along Juan de Fuce fetch
Have not done this yet. Adding a wind report is defintly the next step for the wave forcaster. 


## Send out text updates if it looks like the waves are going to be really good 

### Possible Conditions: 

#### A. It is firing at Neah Bay and it looks like it might get good in Fort Ebey 
 If Neah Bay is >10 feet, and dominant wave bearing is within 10 degrees of 100째 E of North. 

 Note: It takes about 2.5 hours for a wave with an 11 second period to make it from Neah Bay to fort Ebey on a slack current

 Report Wind at Neah Bay and New Dungeness also report tide
#### B. It is firing at Neah bay and Fort Ebay 

 If Neah Bay is >10 feet, and New Dungeness Bouy has >5 ft headed within 30째 at Fort Ebey

#### C. It is just firing in Fort Ebey 

If New Dungeness Bouy has >5 ft, and bearing is within 30째 of Fort Ebey

#### D. It is not firing anywhere 

Once the swell has passed, remove updates so that noone wastes thier time going out to check the surf
